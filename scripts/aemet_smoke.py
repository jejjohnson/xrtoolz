"""AEMET smoke-test script — validates the full pipeline (~5-10 min).

What it does:

1. Sets up the paced archive (rate-limited at 120 req/min).
2. Refreshes the station inventory.
3. Fetches twenty years of monthly data (2005-2024) for about two
   stations per community (≈37-40 stations). That's ~7 three-year
   chunks × ~40 stations × 2 hops ≈ 550 network calls, finishing in
   5-10 minutes at the default 0.5 s global pace.
4. Reads the archive back as a GeoDataFrame and prints a brief
   summary.

The scope is deliberately wide enough to exercise the pacing gate,
chunk-stitching, archive append, and GeoParquet round-trip under
sustained load — not just a one-shot validation. If this runs clean
you're safe to launch the long monthly / daily scrapers.

Everything writes to ``scratch/aemet/smoke/`` and logs to
``xrtoolz/.logs/aemet_smoke.log``. Safe to interrupt and re-run.

Run:
    uv run python scripts/aemet_smoke.py
