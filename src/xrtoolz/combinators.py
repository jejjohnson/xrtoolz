"""xarray-specific operator combinators built on `pipekit.Operator`.

Two utilities that come up repeatedly when building diagnostic
pipelines over `xr.Dataset` carriers:

- :class:`Augment` — run an inner operator and *merge* its output back
  into the input Dataset, preserving the input's existing variables.
- :class:`ApplyToEach` — re-instantiate a prototype operator once per
  value of a chosen kwarg and merge all results together.

Each combinator subclasses `pipekit.Operator`, so it composes inside
``pipekit.Sequential`` chains and ``pipekit.Graph`` DAGs. The generic
observation combinator (``Tap``) lives in pipekit itself — import it
directly from ``xrtoolz`` (which re-exports it) or from ``pipekit``.

**Serialization caveat.** ``Augment`` and ``ApplyToEach`` carry nested
``Operator`` state. Their :meth:`Operator.get_config` outputs are
JSON-safe (no live instances inside) for *introspection* — printing,
logging, diffing pipeline structure — but the configs are **not**
constructor-replayable: a literal ``Augment(**cfg)`` /
``ApplyToEach(**cfg)`` round-trip fails, because the constructor
expects live ``Operator`` instances rather than serialized
``{"class", "config"}`` records. A future deserializer with a class
registry would close that gap; until then, the configs are
introspection-only.

The combinators address a structural mismatch between the Layer 1
contract — a single-input operator returns a Dataset, *replacing* the
input — and common pipeline use cases that want to *grow* a Dataset by
appending derived columns. ``Augment`` does the merge-back;
``ApplyToEach`` fans out a single prototype across multiple variables.

class Augment(Operator):
    """Run an inner ``Operator`` and merge its output back into the input.

    The inner operator must accept a Dataset and return a Dataset. The
    return value of :class:`Augment` is ``input.merge(inner(input))`` —
    the input's existing variables are preserved, and the inner op's
    new variables are added alongside.

    The ``merge`` is invoked with ``compat="no_conflicts"`` (xarray's
    safe default), so if the inner op produces a variable name that
    already exists in the input *and the values differ*, the merge
    raises rather than silently overwriting. Diagnostics that share an
    output name with one of their inputs (rare in practice) need to be
    renamed before being wrapped.

    The combinator is the canonical idiom for chaining diagnostics
    inside a ``Sequential``: each step augments the threaded Dataset
    with new columns, so later diagnostics can depend on variables
    added by earlier ones.

    Args:
        inner: The inner :class:`Operator`. Must accept a single
            ``xr.Dataset`` and return an ``xr.Dataset``. Standard
            single-input ``xrtoolz.ocn`` diagnostics
            (``RelativeVorticity``, ``KineticEnergy``,
            ``GeostrophicVelocities``, ``Divergence``, ...) satisfy
            this contract. Two-input metrics (``RMSE``, ``MAE``, ...)
            and operators that return a ``DataArray`` rather than a
            ``Dataset`` do **not** fit and will raise at call time.

    Raises:
        TypeError: If ``inner`` is not an :class:`Operator` (raised at
            construction), or if ``inner(ds)`` does not return a
            ``Dataset`` (raised at call time).
        xarray.MergeError: If the inner op's output collides with an
            existing input variable whose values do not match.

    Example:
        Build a single Dataset carrying every kinematic diagnostic
        for a velocity field::

            from xrtoolz import Augment, Sequential
            from xrtoolz.ocn.operators import (
                RelativeVorticity, KineticEnergy, OkuboWeiss,
            )

            diagnostics = Sequential([
                Augment(RelativeVorticity()),    # adds vort_r
                Augment(KineticEnergy()),         # adds ke
                Augment(OkuboWeiss()),            # adds ow
            ])
            enriched = diagnostics(velocity_dataset)
            # enriched has u, v, vort_r, ke, ow

        Diagnostics that depend on previously-added columns work
        transparently because ``Sequential`` threads the merged
        Dataset forward::

            Sequential([
                Augment(RelativeVorticity()),                # adds vort_r
                Augment(Enstrophy(variable="vort_r")),       # reads vort_r
            ])

        :class:`Sequential` — chain :class:`Augment` calls together.

class ApplyToEach(Operator):
    """Re-instantiate a prototype operator per value and merge results.

    Given a prototype :class:`Operator`, a kwarg name, and a sequence
    of values, :class:`ApplyToEach` builds and runs one new instance
    of the prototype's class per value, varying the chosen kwarg.
    Each resulting Dataset is merged into the input with the same
    safe ``compat="no_conflicts"`` semantics as :class:`Augment`.

    The behaviour is equivalent to::

        Sequential([
            Augment(prototype.__class__(**{**proto_config, kwarg: v}))
            for v in values
        ])

    Each rebuilt operator runs against the **threaded** result, not
    the original input — i.e. the second pass sees the variables added
    by the first pass. This is what makes the equivalence with
    ``Sequential([Augment(...) for v in values])`` exact, and lets
    later sweeps consume variables produced by earlier ones.

    The prototype's ``get_config()`` is read once and used as the
    base kwargs dict for the rebuilt instances. The prototype's class
    must therefore satisfy the *leaf* contract
    ``cls(**proto.get_config())`` — i.e. its ``get_config`` must
    return a dict directly usable as constructor kwargs. All
    single-operator Layer 1 classes in ``xrtoolz`` satisfy this; the
    composite/combinator classes (``Sequential``, ``Graph``,
    ``Augment``, ``Tap``, ``ApplyToEach`` itself) do **not**, because
    their configs carry serialized child records rather than live
    operator instances. ``ApplyToEach`` validates this contract at
    construction time via a sentinel rebuild and raises
    ``TypeError`` with a descriptive message if it fails.

    Each rebuilt operator must produce uniquely-named output
    variables across the value sweep, otherwise the eventual merge
    raises. In practice most diagnostics name their output after the
    input variable they consume (e.g. ``Frontogenesis(scalar="ssh")``
    → ``ssh_frontogenesis``), so this is not usually a concern.

    Args:
        prototype: A configured single-operator :class:`Operator`
            instance. Composite classes such as ``Sequential`` or
            other combinators are not accepted (see contract above).
        kwarg: Name of the constructor kwarg to vary across the
            sweep. Must be a key of ``prototype.get_config()``.
        values: Sequence of values to substitute for ``kwarg``. Each
            entry is used to build one rebuilt operator.

    Raises:
        TypeError: If ``prototype`` is not an :class:`Operator`, or if
            ``prototype.get_config()`` cannot be passed back to its
            class constructor (composite-config case), or if any
            rebuilt op does not return a Dataset.
        ValueError: If ``kwarg`` is not present in
            ``prototype.get_config()``.

    Example:
        Compute frontogenesis for three scalars in one call::

            from xrtoolz import ApplyToEach
            from xrtoolz.ocn.operators import Frontogenesis

            multi_fg = ApplyToEach(
                Frontogenesis(scalar="ssh"),
                kwarg="scalar",
                values=["ssh", "thetao", "so"],
            )
            out = multi_fg(ds)
            # out has ssh_frontogenesis, thetao_frontogenesis,
            # so_frontogenesis merged in alongside the original
            # variables.

        Inside a ``Sequential`` that augments the dataset before and
        after::

            Sequential([
                ValidateCoords(),
