# API Reference

## Variable registry additions

**ERA5 pressure levels.** `reanalysis-era5-pressure-levels` (catalog short
name `era5.pressure_levels`) now describes the CDS pressure-level fields
`u`, `v`, `w` (omega, Pa s⁻¹), `t`, `z` (geopotential) and `q`, each with a
`cds` alias so
`CDSSource(...).download("reanalysis-era5-pressure-levels", Path("uv.nc"), variables=["u", "v"], levels=PressureLevels([1000, 925]))`
emits the CDS form names without hand-typing them (`era5.pressure_levels`
is the catalog short name for that dataset id — see
`describe("era5.pressure_levels")`). The single-level preset gains `blh`
(boundary-layer height). The `wrf` aliases on `u`, `v` and `blh` name the
raw `wrfout` variables that map onto the same CF quantity; `q` carries no
`wrf` alias because `QVAPOR` is a mixing ratio w.r.t. dry air and must be
converted (`q = r / (1 + r)`) before it is CF specific humidity.

**Methane / trace gas.** `xch4`, `xch4_bias_corrected`, `xch4_precision`,
`column_averaging_kernel`, `ch4_profile_apriori`, `dry_air_subcolumns` and
`qa_value` carry the TROPOMI L2 product names as `tropomi` aliases;
`ch4_enhancement` (ppm m) is the EMIT L2B plume-enhancement quantity, and
`ch4_column` (kg m⁻², `atmosphere_mass_content_of_methane`) is the canonical
column-mass output of the `xrtoolz.atm.gas.ch4` operators. All of them
resolve through `xrreader.resolve` and stamp CF attributes through
`apply_cf_attrs`.

## Local L2 products

`LocalL2Source` is the `DataSource` for satellite L2 product files that are
already on disk — nothing is fetched (`download()` raises
`NotImplementedError`). The catalog short names `tropomi.ch4`, `emit.ch4` and
`ghgsat.ch4` (`source="local"`) each map to a product *opener* that turns one
file into a flat CF Dataset:

| Short name | Opener | Kind | Layout |
|---|---|---|---|
| `tropomi.ch4` | `open_tropomi_ch4_l2(path, qa_min=0.5, keep_groups=False)` | `DatasetKind.SWATH` | `(time, scanline, ground_pixel[, layer, level, corner])` |
| `emit.ch4` | `open_emit_ch4_l2b(path, glt_path=None)` | `DatasetKind.SCENE` | `(time, y, x)` |
| `ghgsat.ch4` | `open_ghgsat_ch4_l2(path)` | `DatasetKind.SCENE` | `(time, y, x)` |

**TROPOMI.** The four product groups (`PRODUCT` and
`PRODUCT/SUPPORT_DATA/{DETAILED_RESULTS,INPUT_DATA,GEOLOCATIONS}`) are read
with `xarray.open_datatree` and merged on the shared swath dims. Variables are
renamed through the registry's `tropomi` aliases (`methane_mixing_ratio` →
`xch4`, `methane_mixing_ratio_bias_corrected` → `xch4_bias_corrected`,
`methane_mixing_ratio_precision` → `xch4_precision`,
`methane_profile_apriori` → `ch4_profile_apriori`, `surface_pressure` → `sp`;
`column_averaging_kernel`, `dry_air_subcolumns` and `qa_value` keep their
names, `pressure_interval` has no registry entry and is passed through), and
`latitude` / `longitude` become the 2-D `lat` / `lon` coordinates. Time keeps
the product's shape: the length-1 `time` index is the granule reference time
(`PRODUCT/time`, seconds since 2010-01-01) and the per-scanline `delta_time`
offset is folded into a `scanline_time` `(time, scanline)` datetime64
coordinate. `qa_value < qa_min` pixels are set to NaN (`subset_where`, shape
preserved); `keep_groups=True` keeps the raw product names.

**EMIT.** The L2B enhancement raster (`ch4_enhancement` in ppm m, plus
`ch4_uncertainty` when present) is read from a NetCDF container; `rioxarray`
is not an `xrreader` dependency, so GeoTIFF distributions have to be converted
first. With `glt_path` the scene is orthorectified through the geometric
lookup table (`glt_x` / `glt_y`, 1-based, `0` = no data) and the 2-D `lon` /
`lat` of the orthorectified grid come from the GLT's own `lon` / `lat` or its
GDAL `geotransform` attribute.

**GHGSat.** A per-plume NetCDF with `xch4` (ppb) and/or `ch4_enhancement` on
`(y, x)` and 2-D `latitude` / `longitude`, promoted to `lon` / `lat` coords.

`LocalL2Source.open(dataset_id, path=..., bbox=..., time=..., qa_min=...,
variables=...)` applies the screening after the opener: `bbox` through
`subset_bbox` on the 2-D coordinates (`where(..., drop=True)`), `time` as a
per-scanline mask on `scanline_time` for swaths or a `subset_time` slice for
scenes, and `paths=[a, b]` concatenates granules along `time` in the order
given. `subset_bbox`, `subset_where` and `subset_time` now live in
`xrreader.types` (pure xarray) and are re-exported unchanged by
`xrtoolz.geo`, so the reader can screen without importing `xrtoolz`. See the
[TROPOMI recipe](../recipes/tropomi_ch4_screen.md) for a worked example.
